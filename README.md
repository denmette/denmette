# Hi, I'm Maarten

I'm a tech lead and Java architect who cares deeply about clarity, intent and sustainable software.
I spend most of my time helping teams make better technical decisions, improve existing systems and grow with confidence.

I believe code should communicate intent, tests should explain behavior and software should be built to be understood by humans first.
While I enjoy new technologies, I get the most satisfaction from making complex systems simpler and more readable.

I also like sharing what I learn along the way, through writing, coaching and podcasting.
If you're interested in clean code, pragmatic architecture and real world software engineering, you're in the right place.
